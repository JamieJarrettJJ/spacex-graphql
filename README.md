# 7 Days, 7 Projects - SpaceX GraphQL/Apollo App (Day 4/7)

Simple app built using Angular Framework to display past launch data. Data is provided via the [SpaceX GraphQL API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/ "SpaceX GraphQL API") and Angular services are generated via [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/ "GraphQL Code Generator"). We use Apollo Angular to access data from the frontend. Feel free to fork or download this project if you would like to try this out or use this code as the base to create your own Pathfinding Visualizer.
